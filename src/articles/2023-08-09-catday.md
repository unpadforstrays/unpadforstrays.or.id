International Cat Day is celebrated on August 8th every year. The International Fund for Animal Welfare initiated this day in 2002 to increase awareness and gratitude for cats all over the world.

We want to celebrate this special occasion by sharing some statements about why cats are amazing and how they enrich our lives. We also want to raise awareness about the challenges that cats face around the world and how we can help them.

Cats are more than just cute and cuddly companions. They are intelligent, independent, and adaptable animals that have a rich history and culture. Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years, but they still retain their wild instincts and behaviors. They can communicate with us and each other through body language, vocalizations, and scent marking. They can also learn new skills and tricks, and even solve problems.

Cats are also beneficial for our health and well-being. Studies have shown that owning a cat can lower blood pressure, reduce stress, and improve mood. Cats can also provide emotional support and comfort to people who are lonely, depressed, or anxious. Cats can sense our emotions and respond accordingly, often by purring, rubbing, or cuddling with us.

However, cats also face many threats and challenges in today’s world. Millions of cats are homeless, abandoned, or abused. Many cats suffer from diseases, parasites, or injuries. Some cats are killed by predators, vehicles, or humans. Many cats are also exploited for entertainment and experimentation.

We believe that every cat deserves a safe, healthy, and happy life. That’s why we support various causes and organizations that help cats in need. Yesterday we gifted Sastranekochan ([@sastranekochan](http://instagram.com/sastranekochan)) Club with essential medical supplies and equipments. The acquisition of these items were made possible through the fundraising earlier in June.

We also want to thank everyone — animal welfare campaigners, veterinarians, researchers, rescue groups, shelters, pet stores and especially you. Yes, all of you  _wargi_  Unpad who have been kind to the cats living in our beloved campus.

We invite you to join us in celebrating International Cat Day by doing something nice for your cat or any cat you encounter. Happy International Cat Day from Universitas Padjadjaran! Celebrating our feline friends today and every day.
