# The Club’s World Animal Day 2022 Message: A Shared Planet

### Unpad Street Feeding Animal Friend publishes its World Animal Day 2022 message.

## World Animal Day 2022: A Shared Planet

Every year we herald the World Animal Day by sending a message that does more than creating a festive mood. To us, it is very essential to raise awareness of this day and remind people to follow animal welfare principles.

This year’s theme is ‘A Shared Planet’. It points out that all kinds of life, not just humankind, have a right to this world. Instead of using the planet for our own benefit, we should share it with the other species that also call it home.

A long list of animal cruelty cases might leads you to believe that the world’s issues are so massive that we can do little to help. We cannot end all the problems on our own alone, but the cumulative impact of small acts of kindness from every one of us can be far greater than we imagine.

Across the country, we have been inspired by stories of people volunteering in their communities by helping animals in need. They are examples to us all by showing an extraordinary level of empathy.

As the movement is getting popular, our country will travel a long and winding road toward animal welfare one step at a time. It’s worth remembering that it is often the small steps, not the giant leaps, that bring about the most lasting change.

Yet, change doesn’t always come quick and easy. We believe that change can be brought by ordinary people doing positive things that fulfill their moral obligation to our shared planet — for the betterment of humankind and the animals.

We call everyone to contribute to the times we live in with the spirit of selflessness, love, and hope that shall guide us in the times ahead.

The club wishes our readers, friends, and allies a very well World Animal Day.
