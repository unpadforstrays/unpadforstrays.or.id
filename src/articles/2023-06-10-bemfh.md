### BEM FH Unpad Sharing Joy #3: Joy Shared With Community Cats!

We thanked BEM FH Unpad (Faculty of Law Student Body) and our readers for their support and participation that have made a positive impact on the success of Sharing Joy fundraising programme.

In this  <u>[third episode of Sharing Joy](https://www.instagram.com/p/Csk7D6DSNL2/?igshid=NjZiM2M3MzIxNA%3D%3D)</u>, BEM FH Unpad with Unpad Street Feeding Animal Friend aimed to raise funds for the welfare of community cats living in Universitas Padjadjaran Jatinangor campus.

Sharing Joy #3 amplifies voices to promote animal welfare around us. This program drives positive change, raise awareness among Unpad students, and directly benefits the street animals. It is only through the collective efforts of our compassionate community that we can make a difference in the lives of these voiceless creatures.

We raised Rp1,000,000 from this program. Further, this fund will be used for continuing the Trap-Neuter-Return initiative in June and to purchase necessary medicines. The candidates for this month are as follows. Every single contribution played a vital role in making this initiative successful.
