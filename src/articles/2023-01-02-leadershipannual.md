# Leadership Annual Letter

## Last year, we shared an update on our plans and roadmap for 2022. It is time to look back, review and appreciate what we have achieved.

2022 had been another interesting year. A year of complex things — full of gains and losses, experiences and regrets, and possibilities achieved. As we are starting 2023, we wanted to send a quick note to thank you for following and supporting UnpadSF. We are thankful for everyone who cares, feeds and pets our campus’ street animals. We hope you’ve enjoyed our contents and programs and maybe even learned something in the process.

Furthermore, we wanted to share with you some of the progress we’ve made on our goals and highlight some of these achievements, as well as share what’s in store for the months to come.

# Things we’re making good progress on:

Some achievement and progress has been made last year.

-   **Media success of reflective collar.** Our reflective collar is appreciated by public, getting featured and praised by both local and national media in the likes of  [Detik Network](https://www.detik.com/jabar/jabar-gaskeun/d-6238040/kalung-reflektif-upaya-unpadsf-cegah-kucing-tertabrak-di-jalan),  [iNews](https://jabar.inews.id/berita/puluhan-kucing-di-jatinangor-dipasangi-reflektor-agar-terhindar-dari-kecelakaan/2), and  [Okezone](https://jabar.inews.id/berita/puluhan-kucing-di-jatinangor-dipasangi-reflektor-agar-terhindar-dari-kecelakaan/2).
-   **Better food standard.** At October 2022, our volunteers started to use Virbac NutriPlus gel for their weekly feeding drive. Virbac NutriPlus itself is a golden standard of pets nutrition on the market.
-   **TNR success at Tugu Kujang area.**  3 of 4 female cats in the Tugu Kujang-Taman MRU-GOR Jati area were spayed and the population is currently on manageable number and no new newborn kitten reported. This reflects the success of our area-based TNR strategy which targets female cats first.
-   **Ongoing TNR initiative at northern area.** Last November **w**e trapped Brenda, a local celebrity of FTIP only to be spayed and returned. The public acceptance of this program has given us the confidence to put this program on full throttle. There are currently 2 neutered cats in this area and we planned to do TNR again in January and February.

**Total donations received in 2022: Rp 345.000**

# What’s next

UnpadSF is going to shift its focus into TNR effort for 2023 and beyond. We do have another projects in the pipeline; such as a new our own-made reflective collar and a website currently in development. We hope you will enjoy those too.

So that is the state of UnpadSF at the end of 2022. We’d like to end with a big thank you to all of you whether you’re a casual viewer, a sponsor, donor, or this just popped up in your feed for some reason and you have no idea why. It’s incredibly satisfying to share our interests with you and we are really glad you tuned in.

May we wish you all the best for 2023 and UnpadSF will see you all again very soon!
