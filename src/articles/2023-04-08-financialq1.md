Unpad Street Feeding Animal Friend (UnpadSF) has announced its Q1 2023 financial report as a part of public responsibility and transparency.

Per 1 April 2023, UnpadSF has received a total donation of Rp 1,081,136 made through the official GoPay and QRIS payment channel.

UnpadSF would like to re-iterate its focus and commitment to the TNR program. As a result of that, donation funds will be used exclusively for the TNR fees. All other expenses such as foods and medicines currently self-funded.

With our donors’ supports, UnpadSF wish to continue the ongoing TNR Program. UnpadSF plans to spay 2 female cats in the next months. They are currently under supervision by us.

UnpadSF is able to declare that the current financial state will enable us to do so.

UnpadSF thanks all the donors for their unwavering support.
