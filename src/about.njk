      <p class="text-base text-gray-800">In the heart of a quiet college campus during the tumultuous year of 2020, a small group, primarily from Faculty of Medicine (FK) and Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Science (FMIPA) students found purpose beyond their studies. As the COVID-19 pandemic forced campus life into a halt, these compassionate individuals noticed the plight of street animals that roamed the empty grounds, searching for food and help. With a shared sense of responsibility, they began to gather supplies, setting up feeding schedule and necessary medicines for the vulnerable creatures. Their efforts not only provided sustenance to the animals but also fostered a sense of purpose especially among the senior students, who found solace in their shared mission during such uncertain times.<br><br>
      As word spread about their initiative, students from various faculties began to join the cause, drawn by the spirit of togetherness. The once small group blossomed into a vibrant collective in 2021, in a form of an independent animal charity: <strong>Peduli Hewan Jalanan Unpad / Unpad Street Animal Friend</strong>. Peduli Hewan Jalanan Unpad then began organizing fundraising strategies and awareness campaigns to support their efforts. Among their first campaign was the @unpadstreetfeeding (formerly @unpadcatfeeding) Instagram page. The @unpadstreetfeeding campaign seeks to raise awareness of campus street cats during the pandemic while encouraging responsible feeding practices. They go hand to hand with university lecturers, faculty members, staffs, alumnis and small local business to provide care for street animals in need. Through their dedication, these students not only rescued street animals but also forged lasting friendships, proving that even in the darkest of times, kindness and unity could shine brightly.<br><br>
      To volunteer for a street animal charity is to embark on a journey to connect with creatures often overlooked. With each stroke of a brush, each bowl of food filled, and each gentle pat, we weave a tapestry of compassion. It is not merely about providing basic necessities; it's about offering companionship, understanding, and a sense of purpose.<br><br>
      Unpad Street Animal Friend helps people find a deeper meaning to the overlooked world around us by witnessing the resilience of the human spirit as we work alongside fellow student volunteers, united by a common purpose. And in the eyes of the animals we help, we see a reflection of our own humanity and the fact that we are not alone in this very Earth we live in. It is a humbling experience that reminds us of the importance of empathy, compassion, and the simple act of making a difference.<br><br>
